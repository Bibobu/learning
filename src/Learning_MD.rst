Learning Molecular Dynamics with LAMMPS (version |version|)
################################################################

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code focusing on
materials modeling.

Quoting the first paragraph of the overview section of the manual_:

  LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics (MD) code that models ensembles of
  particles in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state. It can model atomic,
  polymeric, biological, solid-state (metals, ceramics, oxides), granular,
  coarse-grained, or macroscopic systems using a variety of interatomic
  potentials (force fields) and boundary conditions. It can model 2d or 3d
  systems with sizes ranging from only a few particles up to billions.

In this tutorials, you will find step-by-step guides that aim at giving you
some fundamental comprehension of the code, basic input/output manipulation,
visualization of your simulation and finally autonomy in the use of the code.

These tutorials assumes you are familiar with text file manipulation, basic
command-line use and your computer environment. They also assume you already
have LAMMPS executable installed. If not, contact your IT departement or follow
the installation guide from the manual. LAMMPS usage is generally easier on
UNIX like systems (Linux distributions, macOS) so most examples shall assume
this type of environment. On Windows systems, you can set-up WSL to be in an
equivalent environment.
